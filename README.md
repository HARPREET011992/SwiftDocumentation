# 📘 Swift Documentation Playground

Welcome to the **Swift Documentation Playground** — an interactive Swift environment containing the entire Swift language documentation in a playground format.

## 🚀 Purpose

This project brings Swift's official documentation into an Xcode Playground for easy reference, exploration, and experimentation. It’s ideal for learners, educators, and developers who want to explore Swift syntax and concepts directly in an executable format.

## 📂 Structure

The playground is organized into the following sections (or pages):

- **Basics** – Variables, Constants, Data Types
- **Control Flow** – Loops, Conditionals, Switch Statements
- **Functions and Closures** – Declarations, Parameters, Return Types
- **Object-Oriented Programming** – Classes, Structs, Enums, Protocols
- **Error Handling** – `try`, `catch`, `throws`
- **Concurrency** – `async`, `await`, structured concurrency
- **Standard Library** – Common types and functions
- **Advanced Topics** – Generics, Memory Management, etc.

> Each page contains explanatory text and live Swift examples that you can run and edit.

## 📦 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `Swift.playground` in Xcode.
3. Browse through the pages and try running or modifying the code.

## 🧰 Requirements

- **Xcode**: Version 12.0 or later
- **macOS**: Compatible version to run Swift Playgrounds

## 📝 Notes

- This is a **read-only reference**—it’s not a replacement for official documentation, but a companion to help understand and test Swift concepts.
- Content is based on [Swift.org documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/).
